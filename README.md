# better-logging

A better logging system for Unity, that allows you to explore collections and objects in a tree-like structure.

To use simply replace any `Debug.Log`s with `BetterLog.Log`s and open the better console window (Window -> Cookie ->
Better Console)

# WARNING

It's currently in VERY early alpha: a lot of the features are missing and it's only a proof of concept as of right now

# Showcase
